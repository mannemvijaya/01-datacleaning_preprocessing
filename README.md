 Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

 🧠 Objective
Clean and prepare a raw dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing text and formats, and correcting data types.

 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

 📊 Dataset
- Dataset used: [Enter dataset name, e.g., "Superstore Sales Dataset"]
- Rows: 9800
- Columns: 18

🧹 Cleaning Steps Performed
1. Missing Values: Filled missing values in `postal_code` with 0.
2. Duplicates: NO duplicates
3. Column Standardization: Renamed all column names to lowercase with underscores.
4. Date Conversion: Converted `order_date` and `ship_date` to datetime format.
5. Data Types: Verified and corrected column data types.
6. Export: Saved the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_dataset.csv`.

💡 What I Learned
- Practical experience with Pandas for data cleaning
- Importance of consistent formatting and correct data types
- How to prepare raw data for analysis

📁 Files Included
- `task1_cleaning.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook file with all code
- `cleaned_dataset.csv` – Final cleaned dataset
- `README.md` – Summary of the task

 ✨ Output
The dataset is now clean and ready for analysis or modeling.
